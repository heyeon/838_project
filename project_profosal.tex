\section{Abstract}
For this class project, we will look into Network Latency Bottleneck Issues.
There are several factors that influence run time performance. Network latency
may be one of the prime issues, though it has not been given as much
consideration as memory and CPU. Typically, I/O is considered to be a bottleneck
but this may soon change with the increasing popularity of flash based disks. In
this study, we will:
1. Understand typical network topologies of datacenters
2. Analyze influence of topology on network latency
3. Analyze influence of end-hosts and routing policies on network latency
4. Conduct a basic cost-analysis to look into tradeoff between improvement in
latency versus costs
We will evaluate HULL's performance on various topologies generic to
datacenters. 
\subsection{Plan}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Week 1: Analyze topologies to identify areas of increased latency
\item Week 2: Identify an existing benchmark
\item Week 3 - 4: Propose and test our hypothesis
\item Week 5: Analyze results, put together presentation and writeup
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Is there an open source Datacenter simulator that you recommend for
conducting experiments?
\end{enumerate}
